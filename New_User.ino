//Please use the comand Show() instead of LEDS.show().  This will allow for code interruption after a set period in the case of an endless loop.
//Also, please try to avoid endless loops.  The calling function is set to repeat your sequence for 30 seconds, and it's the only sequence running, it will continue to repeat.

//void SequenceA() {
 
 //Place your code here.  this is your playground.  Leave your name and what you want to call this sequence and I can set it up for the next user.  
// Or if you know ths stuff well enough, you can create multiple sequences and call them from line 82 of MainSail.
